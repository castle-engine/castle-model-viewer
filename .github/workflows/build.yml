# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GitHub Actions workflow to build and package the project using Castle Game Engine.
# Details:
# - Builds and packages: creates release packages (zip,tar.gz)
#   for all interesting platforms.
#   Some of them use our self-hosted runners, some use Docker on GH-hosted runners.
# - Uploads the release packages as GitHub release of "snapshot" tag,
#   https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-model-viewer/releases/tag/snapshot
# - Updates the "snapshot" tag to point to the build commit.
